# Java-Data-Structures
A collection of Java implementations for common data structures and algorithms, including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more. Ideal for learning and reference



This repository contains Java implementations of common data structures and algorithms, designed for learning and reference purposes. Each implementation is well-commented and easy to follow, making it ideal for beginners and experienced developers alike.

Key Features:
Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular), Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and more.

Algorithms: Permutations, Reversing a Linked List, and others.

Learning Focus: Detailed comments and explanations to help you understand how each structure works.

Easy to Use: Clone the repo, explore the code, and run examples to see how everything functions.

Contributions Welcome: Feel free to improve the code, add new features, or fix bugs.
